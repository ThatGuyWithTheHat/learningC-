# learningCpp

This is a simple folder where I hold various small programs that I can reference while learning C++

This is an edit I'm doing just to help me learn git-hub.

This repository is for my personal use primarily but feel free to use. Edit. Do your thing with it. 

It is a learning experience after all. Probably bellow you but a good pace for me.
